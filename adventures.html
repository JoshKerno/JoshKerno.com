									<h1>My Story &<br />
									Adventures</h1>
									<p>From growing up in Cornwall to becoming a web developer, and from surfing the Atlantic to BASE jumping around the world. This is how my background in adventure sports shapes my approach to problem-solving and creativity in web development.</p>
								</header>

								<!-- Background & How I Got Here -->
								<section class="background-story">
									
									<p>I'm an adventurer, BASE jumper, and airsports enthusiast from a small town in Cornwall, UK. Growing up, I spent most days outside – skateboarding from age 12, mainly as transport to friends' houses, and surfing when the Atlantic was pumping. Those early years built coordination, balance, and a natural connection to moving fluidly through different environments. Whether it was skating coastal roads or climbing trees we probably shouldn't have, I always felt more alive outdoors.
									
									<br><br>
									That craving took me travelling, reigniting my love for surfing – especially big, heavy waves that force you to confront fear directly. The feeling of being so exposed, humbled, and at the mercy of the ocean is impossible to fully describe, but it grew my respect for nature and its power.
									
									<br><br>
                					I eventually discovered skydiving, initially as a path to BASE jumping. The first jumps cemented what I had always felt in the ocean: deep presence, focus, and appreciation for life. Since then, I've never looked back. BASE opened the door to other forms of flying, from speedflying to parakiting, each discipline expanding my understanding of risk, skill, and self-reliance.
                					<br><br>
									For me, airsports are about more than adrenaline. They're about connection – to the earth, the sky, and to the people you stand next to on exit points. Being in nature with friends, supporting each other in such a raw form where your lives depend on preparation and awareness, is something few will ever understand. It strips away everything inessential, leaving only presence, gratitude, and the truth of who you are.
									<br><br>
									At the same time, I needed a way to sustain this lifestyle – something I could build from anywhere with Wi-Fi. I'd always been drawn to design, problem-solving, and creating things from scratch, so I started learning web development and UI/UX design. What began as curiosity quickly became a craft. I loved the challenge of turning ideas into functional, quality interfaces and pushing myself to constantly improve.
									That skillset became my ticket to living life on the road – chasing seasons, exploring remote places, and flying in some of the best locations on Earth. Now, I get to blend both worlds.</p>
